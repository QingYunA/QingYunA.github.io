## RSS Software

The RSS software I use is `Fluent Reader`, which can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/yang991179/fluent-reader).

The overall interface is quite aesthetically pleasing, which is a major reason for choosing it.

## RSS Feed Sharing

The RSS feeds I commonly use mainly fall into three categories:

* News (e.g., SSPAI, ifanr)
* Gaming (e.g., YY Society)
* Academic (e.g., arXiv)

`Fluent Reader` supports importing local RSS feeds in `.opml` format, so I'm sharing my RSS feed file here.
