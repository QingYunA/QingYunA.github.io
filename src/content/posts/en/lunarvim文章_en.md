I have been using LunarVim for a while now. In the past, I've used nvim, spacevim, and a series of other out-of-the-box vim software. Overall, LunarVim offers a smooth experience and makes adding plugins extremely convenient.
However, installing LunarVim can be quite troublesome, so I wrote this article to help everyone with the installation.

## Required Plugins for LunarVim

- Nvim v0.9.0+
- git
- make
- pip
- python
- npm, node
- cargo
- nerd font
- Optional: lazygit

Let's proceed step by step with the installation.

## Nvim v0.9.0+

In most Ubuntu systems, `apt-get install` cannot fetch the latest version of nvim. Therefore, we use the official recommended method from GitHub for direct installation.
Download the AppImage.

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim.appimage
chmod u+x nvim.appimage
./nvim.appimage
```

The above command will likely fail. **If it fails, after running the above commands**, run the following commands:

```bash
./nvim.appimage --appimage-extract
./squashfs-root/AppRun --version
```

Create a symbolic link for nvim. After executing the following code, the classic Nvim interface will appear, indicating that Nvim has been successfully installed.

```bash
sudo mv squashfs-root /
sudo ln -s /squashfs-root/AppRun /usr/bin/nvim
nvim
```

## git

Most Ubuntu installations come with git pre-installed. If not, install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

## pip + python

pip is generally bundled with Python, so installing Anaconda will install both pip and Python.

```bash
cd ~
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Press Enter.

Press the down arrow key twice.
When asked if you accept the license terms, enter `yes`.

Here, you are asked if you want to change the installation path for Anaconda3. If you do not wish to change it, simply press Enter to proceed with the installation.

## npm + node

npm and node are also installed together. Here, I choose the easiest method using nvm.

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, use `nvm ls-remote` to see the available versions. Choose the latest one. Here, I chose version 18.18.

```bash
nvm install v18.18.0
```

After execution, npm and node will be installed.

## cargo

cargo can be installed directly using this automated script:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

## Nerd font

Nerd Font is crucial for displaying various icons correctly in LunarVim.
If you are a Windows user, you can directly download the required Nerd Font from the [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) official website and install it. It is recommended to choose `FiraCode`. After installation, connect to the server via Windows Terminal SSH and change the font to the desired Nerd Font in the settings.

If you are an Ubuntu user, refer to the [recommended installation method](https://github.com/ronniedroid/getnf) provided by LunarVim.

## lazygit

After installing lazygit, you can quickly open it in the LunarVim terminal using the shortcut `<space><g><g>`.
If you are not familiar with lazygit, please refer to the author's [GitHub link](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).

```bash
# Install lazygit. Note: This is only applicable to Ubuntu systems.
LAZYGIT_VERSION=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest" | grep -Po '"tag_name": "v\K[^"]*')
curl -Lo lazygit.tar.gz "https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest/download/lazygit_${LAZYGIT_VERSION}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz"
tar xf lazygit.tar.gz lazygit
sudo install lazygit /usr/local/bin
```

## Official Installation of LunarVim

Use the official installation method provided:

```bash
LV_BRANCH='release-1.3/neovim-0.9' bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LunarVim/LunarVim/release-1.3/neovim-0.9/utils/installer/install.sh)
```

During the process, if prompted, enter `yes` for all questions.

Great! By now, you have successfully installed LunarVim and can start using it.
If you cannot start LunarVim directly via the `lvim` command in bash, it is likely that your environment variables are not configured correctly. Refer to my configuration below (there will be a prompt after installing lvim).
Note: Replace `user` with your actual username.

```bash
export PATH="/home/user/.local/bin/:$PATH"
```

Additionally, to avoid the hassle of typing `lvim` every time, you can add the following to your bashrc or zshrc:

```bash
alias vim=lvim
```

This maps vim to lvim. Remember to `source` to update.

## My Configuration File

Since `LunarVim` is already extremely user-friendly out of the box, I havenâ€™t made many personal configuration changes. Mainly, I set ESCAPE to `jj` and added some commonly used plugins.
